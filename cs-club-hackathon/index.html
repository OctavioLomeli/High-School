      <h3 class="subheaders">Description</h3>
      <p>
        In this website, you will talk with a bot. The bot has three ways of
        speaking. It can speak academically, casually, or with a lot of slang.
        By the end of the game, we hope that you learned how to code switch.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheaders">Definitions</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Academic</b> - The type of English you would see in essays or
        professional settings.<br />
        <b>Casually</b> - The type of English you would speak with a friend or
        family.<br />
        <b>Slang</b> - A more 'extreme' version of casual. It sometimes gives
        new definitions for words.<br />
        <b>Code switching</b> - The process of shifting from one linguistic code
        to another, depending on the social context or conversational setting.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheaders">Instructions</h3>
      <p>
        The bot will say something that is either slang, casual, or academic.
        You will be provided four sentences to choose from to respond with. Each
        response will provide either -1, -.5, .5 or 1 point. Your goal is to
        decide which sentence best matches the type of English the bot spoke
        with.
        <br /><br />You can win by getting 6 points. You can lose by getting -3
        points or failing to get 6 points within 12 conversations. Your points
        will be displayed on the screen.
