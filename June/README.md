# June - Discord Bot
## This is a discord bot created for the computer science club at my former high school.
### The bot uses the Discord API and Google Sheets API in Python.
### Members of the club often interact with the bot in order to see upcoming events. This repo will not have updated csv files, so keep that in mind if you are wondering why some of the dates are blank
#### The everlasting file's purpose is to keep the bot online when hosted on Repl.it
